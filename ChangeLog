    * Added "check.c" and "check.h" which contain functions for checking the
      underlying type of `PyObject' variables.
    * Member `itext_offset' of class `XED' is now exported and may be modified.
    * Implemented the following methods in class `Instruction': `get_length()',
      `get_attribute()' and `get_branch_displacement()'.
    * Member `runtime_address' of class `Instruction' is now exported and may be
      modified.
    * Removed sucky `m_xxx()' macros.
    * Renamed C structures `XED', `Instruction' and `Operand' to `xed_t',
      `instruction_t' and `operand_t' respectively. The class names visible to
      Python have remained the same.
    * `XED_ATTRIBUTE_XXX' constants are now visible to Python.

    * Added `Operand' Python class implemented in "operand.c".
    * Implemented more methods in "instruction.c".
    * Added BSD 2-clause license.

    * First release of `pyxed'. Doesn't do anything useful yet; it can only
      print decoded instructions in Intel format.
